            <h4 id="center" class="textup">~INTRODUCTION~</h4>
            <p id="left">Hi my name is Jahdai Searles and this is my 1000 word story of my journey to successfully learning a frontflip without professional help or assistants. "Oh wow a frontflip!.. not interesting or impressed". You might not think so but my journey was a lot more interesting and complex than you may think. Ive learned to ignore people who may put you down, learned that it takes constant effort to succeed, and learned a new world in body control and the art in parkour & freerunning.</p>
            <div class="pkGif"><img src="_include/video/frontflipGIF.gif" alt="gif" style="width:520px;height:290px;"></div>
            <h4 id="center">~PHASE 1: INSPIRATION~</h4>
            <p id="left">My story begins when I was around 10 years old when growing up in a small town house near Scarborough Ontario. As young as I could remember I’ve watched movies with martial arts and acrobatic movements that had a great influence on me. I especially loved Jacky Chan in the 1998 movie Rush Hour. Jacky Chan displayed great acrobatics and martial arts that had got my attention at a young age. </p>
            <p id="left">As long as I remember I had wanted to move like Jacky Chan in the movies. But as a child I never thought I would ever be as good or ever try to do what I had seen in the movies. The closest thing I had to a frontflip was flipping on my bed at 10 years old and getting in trouble for it. </p>
    		<h4 id="center">~PHASE 2: FIRST ATTEMPT ON SAND~</h4>
            <p id="left">Years had passed and I had continued to pursue sports, eating healthy and staying fit. One day during summer camp my friends and I visited the nearest beach near our campgrounds. On the beach campers had done things like swimming, volleyball, basketball, sun bathing and sandcastle making. After playing basketball, swimming and just relaxing with friends I found something new to do while I was there. As a athlete who loves trying new things I had decided it would be a good idea to attempt to push myself into jumping over a sandcastle the campers were done with and taken down. I had completed jumping over the tall sandcastle a few times till I decided to do something different. I decided it would be safe for me to flip onto the sandcastle and land on my back because the sand was soft and the sandcastle looked confortable to lie on.  </p>
            
            <p id="left">I had positioned myself and when I felt ready I charged the sandcastle, jumped up and landed onto my back as if I was a kid again who just loved flipping onto my bed when my parents weren’t looking. I had successfully landed onto my back with ease. I had got onto my feet to try it once more. My second go at simply landing onto my back over the sandcastle went just as good as the first. Time passes jumping onto my back over the sandcastle while others watch and I felt great. I can feel my heart pumping from being active and jumping around on the beach. About three to four minutes of jumping onto the sandcastle I realize I wasn’t scared of jumping as high as I could and landing on my back. I decided I would try to land on my bottom instead of my back. After attempting to land on my bottom two or three times I had landed onto my bottom at the very top of the sandcastle. I didn’t realize till now that I must have been to my waist height when I landed on my bottom, which is really impressive because it was the closest I’ve ever been to landing the frontflip back then. So I had landed on my bottom at the very top of the sandcastle not realizing that I had been progressing closer and closer in landing a frontflip. As my friends left the water after swimming I went back to my running position and went for it for my friends not thinking about getting hurt or looking silly in front of them. I jumped up as high as I could held my knees and rotated till I landed onto my feet on the battered sandcastle. I had landed my first frontflip. My friends were amazed and I was simply shocked that I had landed onto my feet.  My goal was never to land onto my feet and do my first frontflip but maybe because my friends were watching me I had an extra jolt of energy to jump higher and spin faster without being my attentions. After landing my first frontflip I had practiced what I had just done for maybe four minutes till I rested a little before we had to leave the beach. </p>
            <p id="left">The next few days in camp I had spoken to my friends about the frontflip that I had done and couldn’t wait to try the frontflip again when we visit the beach in a few days. </p>
    		<h4 id="center">~PHASE 3: MILESTONE~</h4>
            <p id="left">A few days later we visit the beach for the very last time of the summer break. I had been thinking hard about doing more frontflips at the beach. Once at the beach I had noticed campers who had made the sandcastles the last time we visited the beach decided they wouldn't make sandcastles today. So I had no sandcastle to practice my frontflip over.</p>
            
            <p id="left">Feeling like I had no way of practicing the frontflip I decided to simply try it onto the sand that was everywhere because we were on a beach. I went into my frontflip attempt stance ran up to the spot I wanted to attempt the frontflip. I had jumped, held my knees in close to my body and then splat. I had landed onto my bottom sand got sand into my eyes and everywhere else. At that moment I had learned that the sandcastle had helped me jump higher with my frontflip attempts. So I had decided to begin mentally psyching myself out by thing there was always something in front of me that I needed to frontflip over so that I could continue moving forward. With that mindset I had attempted the frontflip without a safety guard of a sandcastle. I eventually understood I had to jump as high as I could to land a frontflip. I had successfully landed the frontflip almost landing on my bottom a number of times before we left the beach to get back to campgrounds. Leaving the beach my challenge I had given myself was to officially learn how to control and land the frontflip anytime I wanted. </p>
    		<h4 id="center">~PHASE 4: FIRST ATTEMPTS AWAY FROM BEACH~</h4>
            <p id="left">Weeks later after summer camp discovering a frontflip and having a taste of living my dream of trying out what I’ve been influenced with as a young kid I had wanted to try to frontflip once more. Being in highschool now and being in a class called multimedia I had owned my own high definition camcorder. I loved video and editing on the computers at school. One day with my camcorder I decided to go ahead and visit my local park to see if I could still frontflip. </p>

            <br>
    		<h4 id="center">~PHASE 5: EXPLORING PARKOUR & FREERUNNING~</h4>
            <p id="left">One year had passed and I had been practicing my frontflip for most of the year. One big advantage I had when learning the frontflip was the time when I had learned that it was easier to practice the frontflip on a trampoline. My good friend and his brothers owned a trampoline in the backyard I had practiced the backflip extensively. I got better overtime playing on the trampoline and later had learned the backflip.  Both my friends and I had fun learning simple flips on the trampoline that year. </p>

            </div>
            <br>
    		<h4 id="center">~PHASE 6: DREAMS CONQUERED~</h4>
            <p id="left">Four to five years later and I had experienced a lot. I had got into parkour and freerunning learning how to move from point A to B as safe and fast as physically possible from tutorials online and had loved almost every step of the experience. I had got to learn a number of different flips besides the frontflip. I had also learned to move through the environment with my mind and body just like Jacky Chan in the movies. And I had made tutorials with my talent in media production. I'll continue my casual training in martial art called parkour and freerunning as long as I could still do it. </p>
